		  namely fairness. Much of the reported research is
		  still in the form of technical reports, theses and
		  conference papers, and only a small part has already
		  appeared in the formal scientific journal
		  literature. Fairness is one of those concepts that
		  can intuitively be explained very briefly, but bear
		  a lot of consequences, both in theory and the
		  practicality of programming languages. Scientists
		  have traditionally been attracted to studying such
		  concepts. However, a rigorous study of the concept
		  needs a lot of detailed development, evoking much
		  machinery of both mathematics and computer
		  science. I am fully aware of the fact that this
		  field of research still lacks maturity, as does the
		  whole subject of theoretical studies of concurrency
		  and nondeterminism. One symptom of this lack of
		  maturity is the proliferation of models used by the
		  research community to discuss these issues, a
		  variety lacking the invariance property present, for
		  example, in universal formalisms for sequential
		  computing.},
